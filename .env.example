# ============================================
# EMAIL CONFIGURATION (Optional for local dev)
# ============================================
#
# Option 1: Use Gmail with App Password (RECOMMENDED for testing)
# ----------------------------------------------
# This allows you to actually send and receive test emails locally.
#
# How to get a Gmail App Password:
# 1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
# 2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
# 3. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 4. Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
# 5. Enter "Tennis Club Dev" as the name
# 6. Click "Generate"
# 7. Copy the 16-character password (no spaces)
# 8. Paste it into MAIL_PASSWORD below
#
# See docs/EMAIL_SETUP.md for detailed instructions with screenshots.
#
# Gmail Configuration:
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=true
MAIL_USE_SSL=false
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=noreply@tennisclub.de

# Development email redirect (optional)
# When set, all emails in development mode will be sent to this address
# This prevents accidentally sending test emails to real member addresses
DEV_EMAIL_RECIPIENT=your-email@gmail.com
#
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# Option 2: Disable email sending (leave empty)
# ----------------------------------------------
# If you don't want to set up email for local development,
# just leave MAIL_USERNAME and MAIL_PASSWORD empty.
# The app will continue to work, but emails won't be sent.
#
# MAIL_USERNAME=
# MAIL_PASSWORD=
#
# ============================================

# ============================================
# TESTING YOUR EMAIL CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# After setting up your email credentials:
# 1. Start your Flask app: flask run
# 2. Test email sending: flask test-email your-email@gmail.com
# 3. Create a test reservation to trigger booking confirmation email
# 4. Check your inbox for the test emails
